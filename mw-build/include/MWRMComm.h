		/** When investigating the master-side bottleneck problem, we realized 
		 *  that sometimes the master can't handle all the messages sent from the 
		 *  many masters and the RMComm layer. The messages are accumulated in the 
		 *  RMComm layer's buffer (especially in the case of using MW-CondorPvm), 
		 *  but the master can't see them, not to mention process them or delete 
		 *  useless messages. This makes the master unable to accormodate the chanegs
		 *  in the environment, also makes most of the workers waiting for new tasks.

		 *  One way to deal with this situation is to pull all the messages in the 
		 *  underlying message passing layer and let the master buffer them by 
		 *  itself, to separate the message receiving and message processing steps. 
		 *
		 *  Thus we will introduce a FIFO list of buf_id (list of *int), each of the
		 *  buf_id points to a message buffer in PVM (and likewise in the other 
		 *  RMComms). The original message processing steps are: 
		 *  	RMC->recv()
		 *  	RMC->bufinfo()
		 *  	RMC->unpack(), RMC->unpack()
		 *  And now the process will be the same, but implementation is different:
		 *  	RMC->recv_all()	pull all messages out (in a non-blocking way) and 
		 *  			put each message's buf_id into the FIFO list.
		 *  	RMC->recv()	blocking recv	
		 *  	RMC->bufinfo()	examine the buf_info of the buffer with given buf_id
		 *  	RMC->setrbuf()	will be used to switch the active receive buffer
		 *  	RMC->freebuf()  will be used to free useless receive buffer
		 *  	RMC->unpack()
		 *  	
		 *  All recv will via the buffer_list now!
