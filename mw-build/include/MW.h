/**@name Introduction.

   MW is a class library that can be a useful tool for building
   opportunistic, fault-tolerant applications for high throughput
   computing.  

   In order to build an application, there are three classes
   that the user {\rm must} rederive.

   \begin{itemize}
   \item \Ref{MWDriver}
   \item \Ref{MWWorker}
   \item \Ref{MWTask}
   \end{itemize}

   The documentation of these classes includes a description 
   of the pure virtual methods that must be implemented for 
   a user's particular application.

   Using the MW library allows the user to focus on the application
   specific implementation at hand.  All details related to
   being fault tolerant and opportunistic are implemented in the
   MW library.

   Also included is a small, naive, example of how to create
   an application with the MW class library.  The three classes

   \begin{itemize}
   \item \Ref{Driver_Fib}
   \item \Ref{Worker_Fib}
   \item \Ref{Task_Fib}
   \end{itemize}
   
   are concrete classes derived from MW's abstract classes.  
   Using these classes, a simple program that makes a lot of 
   fibonacci sequences is created.
