/* TASK CLUSTERING / WORK CYCLE */

/** This class is responsible for managing an application in an 
    opportunistic environment.  The goal is to be completely fault - 
    tolerant, dealing with all possiblities of host (worker) problems.  
    To do this, the MWDriver class manages a set of tasks and a set 
    of workers.  It monitors messages about hosts coming up and 
    going down, and assigns tasks appropriately.

	This class is built upon some sort of resource management and 
	message passing lower layer.  Previously, it was built directly 
	on top of Condor - PVM, but the interface to that has been 
	abstracted away so that it can use any facility that provides 
	for resource management and message passing.  See the abstract
	MWRMComm class for details of this lower layer.  When interfacing
	with this level, you'll have use the RMC object that's a static
	member of the MWDriver, MWTask, and MWWorker class.  

    To implement an application, a user must derive a class from this
    base class and implement the following methods:

    - get_userinfo()
    - setup_initial_tasks()
    - pack_worker_init_data()
    - act_on_completed_task()
  

	For a higher level of control regarding distribution of tasks to workers, 
	tasks and workers may be enrolled to workclasses/groups by calling the
	following methods:

	- MWWorkerID::addGroup()
	- MWWorkerID::deleteGroup()
	- MWTask::addGroup()
	- MWTask::deleteGroup()

	These methods can be called by an application using workclasses:
	
	- workClasses_set()  (Required)
	- workClasses_get()
	- workClasses_gettasks()
	- workClasses_getworkers()

	To enroll workers in workclasses, there are two options:
	- act_on_starting_worker() can be implemented to enroll workers to 
	workclasses based on MWWorkerID info at the start of execution
	- pack_worker_init_data() can be implemented to enroll workers. When used 
	in conjunction with refreshWorkers(), can change workclass of workers in the 	middle of execution.	

    Similar application dependent methods must be implemented
    for the "Task" of work to be done and the "Worker" who performs
    the tasks.

  /** @name E. Checkpoint Handling Functions
			
      These are logical checkpoint handling functions.  They are
      virtual, and are *entirely* application-specific.  In them, the
      user must save the "state" of the application to permanent
      storage (disk).  To do this, you need to:
			
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Implement the methods write_master_state() and
      read_master_state() in your derived MWDriver app.
      \item Implement the methods write_ckpt_info() and 
      read_ckpt_info() in your derived MWTask class.
      \end{itemize}
			
      Then MWDriver does the rest for you.  When checkpoint() is
      called (see below) it opens up a known filename for writing.
      It passes the file pointer of that file to write_master_state(), 
      which dumps the "state" of the master to that fp.  Here 
      "sate" includes all the variables, info, etc of YOUR
      CLASS THAT WAS DERIVED FROM MWDRIVER.  All state in
      MWDriver.C is taken care of (there's not much).  Next, 
      checkpoint will walk down the running queue and the todo
      queue and call each member's write_ckpt_info().  
      
      Upon restart, MWDriver will detect the presence of the 
      checkpoint file and restart from it.  It calls 
      read_master_state(), which is the inverse of 
      write_master_state().  Then, for each task in the 
      checkpoint file, it creates a new MWTask, calls 
      read_ckpt_info() on it, and adds it to the todo queue.
			
      We start from there and proceed as normal.
			
      One can set the "frequency" that checkpoint files will be 
      written (using set_checkpoint_frequency()).  The default
      frequency is zero - no checkpointing.  When the frequency is
      set to n, every nth time that act_on_completed_task gets 
      called, we checkpoint immediately afterwards.  If your
      application involves "work steps", you probably will want to 
      leave the frequency at zero and call checkpoint yourself
      at the end of a work step.
