This directory contains files that one could use as a "code skeleton"
for their project.  The files included are:


Makefile	: You'll have to edit this, of course...
README		: This file
user_driver.C	: - Derived class of the MWDriver
user_driver.h	: --/
user_task.C	: - Derived class of the MWTask - your 'definition' of a task.
user_task.h	: --/
user_worker.C	: - Derived from MWWorker - how to do your work. 
user_worker.h	: --/
mastermain.C	: Where 'main()' resides for the master.  Little else.
workermain.C	: Ditto for the worker.
in_master	: Input to your master.
submit_pvm	: A sample submit file for condor.
work_steps-HOWTO: If your application uses "work steps", look here.

There is ample documentation inside each file...

Note that this is a MINIMAL description of an implementation.  To 
get an idea of the full functionality of the MW software, read 
the documentation!
