    This the class that represents a unit of work. 

    The task consits of two main components.  The "work" to be done,
    and the "result" of the completed task.
    In order to create an application, the user must specify methods
    for packing and unpacking both the "work" and "result" portions
    of the task.
    The user is not responsible for initializing the send
    or for packing the task's number    

    When the task is being serviced by a worker, it contains a link
    to the ID of that instance of the worker.
