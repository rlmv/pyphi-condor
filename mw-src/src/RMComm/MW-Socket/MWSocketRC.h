		Unlike MWPvmRC, the communication routines are non-trivial

		Thus we use files for communication. So a send is essentially
		a file write operation and a recv is a file-read operation.
		We maintain 2 lists:- The sendList and recvList for taking 
		care of what is to be written/read to/from the files. As in
		pvm a user beings by calling initsend which creates a new list.
		Calls to pack insert into the list what is being packed. And
		finally a send writes the entire thing into a file 
		identified by the destination. Corresponding things happpen
		in recv.
