# ------------- Prepare to install MW -----------------------
1) Install Condor first, and make sure that the condor execs
   are in your path. For example, you can add the following 
   lines in your .cshrc file. 

	set path = ( $path /unsup/condor/bin )
	set path = ( $path /unsup/condor/sbin )

   For bash and other sh type shells, the command would be
	export PATH = $PATH:/unsup/condor/bin:/unsup/condor/sbin	

2) Install Condor-PVM or PVM with proper changes (refer the 
   README.Condor-PVM file under /afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/condor/workspaces/pvm) 
   so that it works with Condor. Also update your environment variables:
	setenv PVM_ROOT  /p/condor/workspaces/pvm/pvm3.4.2
	setenv PVM_ARCH  <proper_name: LINUX X86SOL2 SGI6 etc>

	sh style shells

	export PVM_ROOT=/p/condor/workspaces/pvm/pvm3.4.2
	export PVM_ARCH=LINUX

3) There are several options for debugging: 
   -- The default result of "make check" will produce master and worker
      application using MW-Independent (which is developed for debugging).
      You can "setenv MW_DEBUG no" to turn this off.
   -- You can also use Insure to detect memory related bugs. To do this, 
      you need to "setenv DEBUG_BUILD insure" and setup the path variable.
      As insure doesn't work with MW-File, this setting will produce 
      master and worker app using MW-File. 


# -------------- How to build MW -----------------------------
tar zxf mw.tar.gz
cd mw; ./configure #--prefix=/tmp/mw
make; make check 	# The typical command to build MW

  --with-condor           Use the given condor installation path
  --with-pvm              Use the given pvm installation path
  --with-measure          Build with -DMEASURE
  --with-independent      Build MW-Independent library


# -------------- Other targets --------------------------------
make 		# Build MW libraries, without installing them
make install 	# (Build and) install MW libraries
make check	# Build examples (after building libraries)
make clean	# Cleanup the exes, libs, and object files
make distclean  # Cleanup for distribution

# ------------- How to run the examples ----------------------
cd examples/fib
condor_submit submit_mwfile	# submit the job using MW File
